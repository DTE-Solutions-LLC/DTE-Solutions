                    Standard cloud tools — Notion, Google Docs, shared drives —
                    were prohibited. No BAA, no compliance. Any solution
                    handling PHI had to meet HIPAA&apos;s Security Rule without
                    transmitting data to any external server. That constraint
                    ruled out virtually every off-the-shelf tool on the market.
                    It also meant session management, idle timeouts, and PHI
                    retention policies all had to be engineered client-side.

                This project sits at an unusual intersection: clinical
                compliance, zero-infrastructure security, and a genuine need to
                reduce burnout for frontline staff.

                The constraint of &quot;no cloud tools&quot; that initially
                seemed like a limitation turned out to be the design brief. A
                stateless, browser-based architecture wasn&apos;t a workaround —
                it was the right answer. By keeping everything in volatile
                memory, I eliminated both the HIPAA risk and the IT bottleneck
                in a single architectural decision.

                The result covers every Missouri PCSP domain, satisfies
                HIPAA&apos;s Security Rule without a BAA or a server, enforces
                PHI retention policies client-side, and gets case managers from
                blank page to audit-ready narrative in under two minutes.
                That&apos;s the kind of problem frontend engineering is uniquely
